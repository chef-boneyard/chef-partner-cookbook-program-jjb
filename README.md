# chef-partner-cookbook-program-jjb

These are a collection of Jenkins Job builders for the [Chef Partner Cookbook Program][cpcp].
The goal is to get a build per [this search][search] and have the verification
continually authenticated.

There is a way to switch out tokens and other secrets for your jobs with a
couple rake tasks.

You need to set up a `secrets.yml` with something like the following:

```yaml
slack-auth-token: "KK5ZzeJhcMVBgM54_ANOTHER_FAKE_KEY_vTwZxJpuUYXetFnlha81EyH"
slack-build-server-url: "KK5ZzeJhcMVBgM54_ANOTHER_FAKE_KEY_vTwZxJpuUYXetFnlha81EyH"
```
