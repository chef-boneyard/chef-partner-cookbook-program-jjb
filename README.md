# chef-partner-cookbook-program-jjb

These are a collection of Jenkins Job builders for the [Chef Partner Cookbook Program][cpcp].
The goal is to get a build per [this search][search] and have the verification
continually authenticated.

## Dealing with secrets/tokens with the JJB

There is a way to switch out tokens and other secrets for your jobs with a
rake task.

You need to set up a `secrets.yml` with something like the following:

```yaml
slack-auth-token: "KK5ZzeJhcMVBgM54_ANOTHER_FAKE_KEY_vTwZxJpuUYXetFnlha81EyH"
slack-build-server-url: "https://jenkins-01.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com/"
```

After this you can run the following:

```bash
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec rake
```

## Our Jenkins set up

We have our Jenkins setup [here][jenkins]. It's public and you're more then
welcome to take a look at it.

If you would like to update any of the jobs, you need to use the [update jobs][updatejobs]
job. Clone down the repo, and if it changes at all it'll update the corresponding
jobs.
